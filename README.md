RMS Notification Templates
==========================

A set of responsive HTML email notification templates for RMS Enterprise.


## Usage

1. Modify to suit your purposes
2. Inline all CSS (you'll need to keep the additional @media query contained css in some style tags though)
3. Inject into appropriate RMS DB fields

Currently the RMS web UI only supports WYSIWYG editing of HTML notification templates. To get around this these need to be written directly to the RMS database. If you do not how to do this turn around now and back away slowly. Needless to say make sure everything is backed up prior to attempting this.
